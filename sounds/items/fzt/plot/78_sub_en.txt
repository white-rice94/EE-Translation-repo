141:Because of the word "Exit."
1941:Emergency exit,
3180:The sign indicates an exit.
5275:The small figure in the middle of the doorframe,
7059:Must be walking outward.
9289:However,
10358:The one we chose earlier...
13248:Remember when we used the process of elimination the second time?
16408:Among the three remaining signs,
17866:Two were identical,
19759:With no white dot under the figure's feet.
22002:And one sign was different,
25208:With a white dot under the figure's feet.
29114:The key,
30034:Is that white dot.
32066:I just realized,
33898:This might not be an ordinary white dot,
37098:But rather represents the figure's shadow!
39859:Outside the door is the bright area,
42107:The light from outside shines on the figure,
44824:Casting a shadow beneath their feet,
47387:This confirms the figure is walking outward,
50419:If the sign with the shadow under the figure indicates walking outward,
54188:Then the sign we originally chose,
56552:With no shadow under the figure,
58839:Must mean the figure is walking inward!
63017:Oh,
63524:So that's how it is!
