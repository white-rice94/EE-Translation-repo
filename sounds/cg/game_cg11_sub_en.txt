91: Hey bro, how is it? What's the situation?
3515: Dude, I see the emergency exits!
6473: What?
7575: Yeah, but they're not real exits, they're just signs... there are four of them, one on each wall.
15846: Four signs? Bro, do you remember what was written on the note? "Find the correct emergency exit, and the door will open."
24983: So you're saying, we need to choose the correct one out of these four signs?
31197: I think, that's how it is.
33732: What happens if we choose the wrong one?
36617: Maybe, we won't be able to get out.
