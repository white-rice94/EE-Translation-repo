3323: Fan Zhituo had been awake for a few days since regaining consciousness, and his physical condition was gradually improving.
9757: The following is a special report. At 10 a.m. today, a major fire broke out at a密室逃脱 (mishi taotuo - escape room) venue under construction on Wanghai Road. The cause of the fire is suspected to be related to non-standard wiring radiation. Two workers were trapped on the scene when the accident occurred. After a full search and rescue by the fire brigade, one person was found in the fire escape and sent to the People's Hospital for treatment due to inhaling too much smoke; the other person inadvertently triggered a mechanism while escaping and was trapped in the密室 (mishi - secret room) under construction, and was found with no vital signs...
44244: Hello.
54963: Officer, are you looking for me?
58280: Yes. I'm Wang Wei, the captain of the Criminal Investigation Detachment of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. I'm here today mainly to learn about the circumstances of the fire at the Illusion Game Hall. Don't be nervous. Just tell me what happened at the time.
78113: O-okay, I'll tell you everything I know.
82597: Shortly after waking up, Fan Zhituo's memory returned. He vividly recounted everything he experienced during the fire to Captain Wang.
99903: So, you and Zheng Ming once tried to escape together after realizing you were trapped? How did you separate later?
109306: Zheng Ming said he knew a shortcut to the door, but I insisted on following the emergency exit signs, so we separated.
118607: Okay, I understand, thank you for your cooperation. You have very good fire safety awareness! It's a pity the fire was too big that day, causing you to inhale too much smoke. The doctor said you were unconscious in the intensive care unit for several days. On behalf of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, I wish you a speedy recovery.
138324: Thank you.
140508: Then you should rest well, I won't bother you any longer. I'll be going now.
144355: Okay, Officer, goodbye.
155248: Reality and dreams clash in my mind again and again. Every time I close my eyes, Zheng Ming's face appears before me. Whenever I see him, I always feel regret, regret that I didn't try harder to persuade him back then. I always think, if I had said a few more words back then, maybe it could have been like he said at the time of parting.
182041: "Maybe we'll end up in the same place in the end... I'll see you outside!"
188844: Unfortunately, it didn't turn out the way you said, we ultimately never met again.
