943: To leave this place, we must help each other. We both have reasons to get out, and no one has the right to decide the other's fate, so let heaven decide who takes the risk!
14272: What do you mean?
15885: We still don't know what it means to "find" the correct emergency exit sign, so from now on, we'll take turns going up, and each person will try a different method. If one person's method is right...
28492: Then we can only pray that the steel door doesn't open inwards.
33371: How can you be sure that the person who goes up won't pull some tricks?
39069: You mean, the person who goes up will pretend to have tried a method, but actually do nothing, and then wait for the other person to try all sorts of methods and then reap the benefits?
50113: Yeah.
53936: Let's do this. The person who goes up has to describe the method they tried to the person below. Methods that don't work will be eliminated, and the next person up will try a new method. If both of us try to pull some tricks, then neither of us will get out.
62488: I came up with this method, so I'll go first. If I fail, it'll be your turn next, and so on.
72709: Sigh, there's no other way now, let's just do that.
87779: Time is of the essence, let's start.
