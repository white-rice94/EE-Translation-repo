4021: Hey bro, do you think we can climb up and grab the sign?
10779: I don't know, but we can try.
14840: Which wall has the correct sign?
18287: That one, over there.
30284: The walls are so smooth, probably to make sure the ceiling can move up and down smoothly. There's not even a ledge to stand on, how are we supposed to get up there?
43820: What if we shout "We found it!" at the correct sign?
50071: It's worth a shot, let's try it.
53787: Hey, we found the correct emergency exit, please open the door!
62714: We found the correct emergency exit, please open the door!
70181: Hah, it's not working, useless.
75363: What do we do? I want to leave here, I want to go home. If one person's life has to be exchanged for another's survival, can I really be so ruthless?
89553: Yeah, we're all human. To survive, we can instantly cooperate seamlessly with strangers. But at the critical moment of life and death, we can also immediately turn on each other.
102712: I want to get out, no matter what, I have to leave here!
114317: That's not right.
115350: This is the only way now...
117843: If you knock me down now, can you guarantee that I'll help you choose the right sign up there?
130617: The ingenuity of this mechanism is that it requires two people to cooperate with each other, but at the same time, one person must be willing to take the risk.
140260: Yes, Fan Zhituo is right. The person who goes up has to bear the risk of not being able to leave, and also help the person below escape. Violence simply can't solve the predicament they're in right now.
158137: I'm such a fucking coward. I even thought about attacking the person who saved my life, just to survive.
